# The Jack One

I love game, love typescript and ______________Jack.
That is what this project existed!!

This is a game with its own engine named `The Jack`.
Dedicated to Jack.

## The Jack One
`The Jack One` is an [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–component–system) game engine.
This project focus on custom engine development, game is a side project for quick concept and function testing.

## Roadmap
- Engine
  - ~~Physics~~
    - ~~PolygonCollider~~
    - ~~Oriented rigid bodies~~
      - Add force at specific point should cause torque.
    - ~~Sleep mechanism~~
  - Camera Manipulation
  - ParticleSystem
  - Animation
- Game
  - Design: Seems Jack like to play raiden-like genre. This infomation is helpful.
  - Art: Doing research.

## Dependencies
- `rxjs`: For manipulate events.
- `reflect-metadata`: For implement decorator functions.
